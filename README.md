# CardFramework-Unity

This is a very basic example demonstrating how to create a framework in Unity for a 3D card game.


Video of app running can be seen here:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrHJLHcWjSA


Currently the app demonstrates these things:
- Drops a deck of cards onto table instantiated from an AssetBundle.
- Allows you to shuffle the deck of cards.
- Allows you to draw a card.
- Allows you to see the last 5 drawn cards.
- All used cards are restacked.
- Cards can be reshuffled and reset at any time.


Technical
- App is built in Unity 5.2.0p1
- Currently only tested to be building and running properly for OSX Desktop x86.
